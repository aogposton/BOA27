# BOA27 | Balloons Over Article 27 | 봐27

BOA27 is an open source, open hardware, smart, leafleting balloon.

Current Estimated Cost per balloon: **$1000**

_Note: Once this repo has 1 completed design, the price counter will change to match
the cost of that balloon. For sake of consistency, shipping costs will be
ignored._

## Background

Article 27 of the Reactionary ideology and culture rejection act of the
Democratic People Republic of Korea states:

> Any person who brings in or distributes South Korean movies, video
> recordings, compilations, and books shall be sentenced to reform through
> labor for life."

This law has made in more difficult than ever to get need information about the
outside world such as health information, educational material, worship
material, or simply entertainment needed to cope with the present day
realities.

In order to support the North Koreans who live under this regime get access to
much needed information, South Korean Activists have been sending balloons
across the border with payloads containing USB drives, leaflets of information,
money, and food. This practice of sending balloons over a boarder is nothing
new. Recently, however, South Korean activist groups have began creating smart
balloons which have GPS trackers, altimeters, and
controlled-release, leaflet dispensers. These smart balloons increase the chances
of getting materials to a target area from the estimated 15% to, according to one
activist group, 50%-60%. [These activist groups report spending up to $1000 per
balloon.](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/NORTHKOREA-SOUTHKOREA/BALLOONS/zdvxxrnzmvx/)

As a community of engineers, developers, and technicians, together we can
architect a smart balloon which is cheaper and maintains a 50% accuracy rate or
higher.

So, in response to the enactment and enforcement this law, with concern for the
human rights and well being of the North Koreans who live under it, and in
support of the brave South Korean activists constructing smart balloons to fly
leaflets, and resources to North Korea, this open source project was created.

The designs, tools, and research here are made public so that any group or
individual of good will may construct a BOA27 to deliver necessary items or
information into a resource or information starved area.

## Design Specifications

Starting from the
[description](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/NORTHKOREA-SOUTHKOREA/BALLOONS/zdvxxrnzmvx/) of smart balloons being used, they:

- can carry a 7.5 Kilo payload
- can reach 9000 meters altitude
- have an altimeter-controlled release valve for controlling the altitude of
  the balloon
- use Hydrogen as the lifting agent
- may contain a speaker which ejects from the balloon and plays songs for up to
  5 days.

## Resources

## TODO

[ ] create a program to calculate the lifting capacity of certain gases.

Things that will always need to be done:

- Check figures and calculations
- Formatting and spell checking.
- find more public sources of information on leaflet balloons and add links
  under research.
- upload or correct a translation of this repo into a folder named after the language.
